# Using Terraform and AWS Cloud to set up static website hosting|Simple Devops Project 

This Terraform script creates an AWS S3 bucket configured to host a static website. It provisions the necessary resources and configurations to enable the bucket to serve static web content.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to simplify the process of setting up a static website hosting environment on AWS using Terraform. This includes provisioning the necessary AWS resources, such as the S3 bucket, and configuring it to serve static web content.

## Features
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Leverage Terraform to define and provision infrastructure resources in a declarative manner.
- AWS S3 Bucket: Create an S3 bucket to store and serve static website files.
- Static Website Hosting: Configure the S3 bucket for static website hosting, enabling it to serve web content directly to users.
- Customizable Configuration: Customize the bucket name, index document, error document, and other parameters to suit specific project requirements.
- Version Control: Keep infrastructure configurations under version control, enabling collaboration and change tracking.

## Project Overview
The project demonstrates the following:
- Terraform setup
- AWS key generation
- Setting up the terrafrom and html files
- Creating S3 bucket and applying the changes 
- Finally hosting the website
